        My educational background is entirely centered around <H>computer science</H>, which I am currently studying at <H>Universit√† degli studi di Milano</H>. Currently, my main focus is on <H>continuous learning</H> and <H>practical application</H> of new technologies across various domains, including <I>web development</I>, <I>complex algorithms</I>, <I>dockerization</I> and <I>networking</I>.

        I also engage in activities unrelated to computers. I have a strong passion for playing basically <H>any sport</H>, particularly <I>football</I> and <I>ping pong</I>. However, I must admit that my <H>competitive nature</H> and desire for <H>precision</H> come into play: whether it&apos;s a casual or competitive game, I always strive to achieve victory and excel in every endeavor I pursue.
        Another thing I really enjoy is pushing my physical limits through activities such as running, cycling or hiking <I><D>(mountain &gt; seaside)</D></I>.

        Returning to computers: I consider myself a decent <H>competitive gamer</H>, competing under the alias of <I><H>imprudenza</H></I>. In the past, I competed in <I>Minecraft</I> <span title="ClanWar BedWars, 4v4 on PigParty or GommeHD"><U>CWBW</U></span>, becoming <span title="PigParty BedWars league, 4v4 on PigParty"><I><D><U>2018 Italian Champion</U></D></I></span> with <I><D>Rebirth</D></I>. In recent years, I transitioned to <I>Rainbow Six Siege</I>, where I secured second place in the <Link to="https://liquipedia.net/rainbowsix/PG_Nationals/2022/BeSerious/Spring" target="_blank" title="BeSerious Spring 2022"><I><D><U>2022 Italian Second Division</U></D></I></Link> with <I><D>P11</D></I>. Due to time constraints, my involvement in competitive gaming has reduced. However, I still occasionally participate in competitive tournaments for fun.
